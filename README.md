# Loan-Project

This dataset typically used to predict the loan approval status (Loan_Status) based on the other attributes.

Key aspects of my project include:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to understand the dataset and identify patterns.

Data Cleaning: Removed outliers to ensure the integrity of the data.

Machine Learning Algorithms: Applied various machine learning algorithms to build predictive models.
